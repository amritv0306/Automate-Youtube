TITLE: Monsoon Mayhem Mumbai Reels Under Record Rainfall

DESCRIPTION:
Mumbai is grappling with unprecedented monsoon fury as record rainfall cripples the city. Transportation networks are severely disrupted, with train services halted and roads inundated, leaving commuters stranded. Authorities are urging residents to stay indoors unless absolutely necessary, as waterlogging reaches dangerous levels in several areas. The heavy downpour has also triggered concerns about landslides in vulnerable zones. Emergency services are stretched thin, responding to distress calls and coordinating rescue efforts. The intense rainfall highlights the city's vulnerability to extreme weather events, prompting renewed discussions about infrastructure resilience and disaster preparedness.
