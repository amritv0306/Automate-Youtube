  "description": "Big news for travelers!  Starting late 2026, the ETIAS fee for visa-free entry to Europe is increasing from €7 to €20. This affects citizens of over 60 countries, including US, UK, and Canada.  The online application process remains simple, taking minutes for most.  The €20 fee funds system operations and security upgrades.  Children under 18 and adults over 70 are exempt, as are certain EU family members.  The European Council and Parliament have two months to review the proposal before the new fee takes effect.  Plan ahead for your European trip after late 2026!",
