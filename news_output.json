  "description": "Tensions rise at JNU's Mahi-Mandavi hostel over separate eating arrangements for vegetarian and non-vegetarian students.  A disagreement between left-leaning students and the ABVP highlights the issue.  Left-wing students oppose the voluntary segregation, while the ABVP supports it, citing religious sentiments of vegetarian students, particularly during the holy month of Shravan.  The ABVP plans protests, criticizing the administration for its perceived inaction. This conflict underscores the complexities of managing diverse dietary needs and religious practices within a shared living space. The situation remains tense as both sides advocate for their respective positions.  The administration's response will be crucial in resolving this sensitive matter.",
